Some interesting projects that I've made:

1) Implementing MapReduce using Hadoop and Scala to analyze log files: https://github.com/utsavns96/CS441_Fall2022_HW1
2) Searching through a log file for a specific log message in a specific timestamp range, using 2 methods - a REST API served by an AWS Lambda function written in Python, and using a gRPC client-server model: https://github.com/utsavns96/CS441_Fall2022_HW1
3)  Using the cloudsim library to implement a simulation of a cloud datacenter infrasturcture, with different network topologies: https://github.com/utsavns96/CloudSim_CS441_HW3
4)  Using C++ and MPICH to calculate the value of PI to a user-selected accuracy term in parallel on UIC's ACER Cluster: https://github.com/utsavns96/Parallel_pi_MPI
5)  Creating a new design for a ridesharing application that we use on campus to perform A-B testing with the existing solution: https://github.com/utsavns96/campus_cruise
6)  An android app that recommends recipes based on the ingredients you have, using an API for general recommendations, and a user recipe section to submit your own recipes and see those created by other users: https://github.com/utsavns96/whatsCooking
